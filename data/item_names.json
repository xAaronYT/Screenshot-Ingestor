Despite the bullet's own characteristics when used in a full-power cartridge, these are affected when transferred to an intermediate cartridge, still, the bullet continues to have capabilities to pierce basic ballistic body protections as well as some intermediate models. However, it has a high bounce probability off various surfaces. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any issues.",

Despite the bullet's own characteristics when used in a full-power cartridge, these are affected when transferred to an intermediate cartridge, however, the bullet continues to have capabilities to pierce basic and intermediate body ballistic protections, in addition to being able to cause substantial adverse effects on the target after impact. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any issues.",
